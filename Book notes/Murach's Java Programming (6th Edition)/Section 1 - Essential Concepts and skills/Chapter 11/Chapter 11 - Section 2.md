## How to code an interface
![[Pasted image 20231105123900.png]]
*- To start coding an interface you code the public keyword, followed by the interface keyword, followed by the name of the interface.*
*- When you name an interface it's common to end the name with a suffix of "able" or "er". For example, the Java API uses names like Cloneable, Comparable, EventListener, ActionListener, and so on.*
*- A common naming strategy is to prefix the name of an Interface with I. For example - "IPrint". *
<p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic; color:#00FFFF">In the first example, the example shows the code for a Printable interface, with a single abstract method named print(), that doesn't accept any arguments or return any data.</p>
- As with all abstract methods, you don't code braces at the end of the method. Instead, you code a semicolon immediately after the parenthesis.
