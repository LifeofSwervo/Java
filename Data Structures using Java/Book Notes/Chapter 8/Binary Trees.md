- These are data structures.

### Why use Binary Trees 
- Combines advantages of an ordered array and linked list.
- Can search, insert, and delete quickly. 

### Slow insertion in an Ordered Array
- Ordered arrays are extremely taxing to insert and delete. 

### Slow Searching in a Linked List
- Linked list on the other hand quickly insert and delete.
- Searching is not easy. The list must be searched in chronological order, until the intended element is found. 
- Ordered linked list do not work as elements cannot be accessed out of order (of the links in the list).
- (Ordered linked list still is typically better for the organization provided.)

### What is a Tree?
- Tree's consist of nodes connected by edges. 
- (In the example nodes are circles, while the edges are lines.)
- Trees have been studied extensively as abstract mathematical entities, so thereâ€™s a large amount of theoretical knowledge about them. 
- A tree is actually an instance of a more general category called a graph. (Visit Chapter 14.)

- Nodes are often entities.
- Lines are the way the nodes relate.
- Generally there is 1 node at the top and the amount steadily increases the further down the tree you go.
- In a binary tree each node has a max of 2 children.
- More general trees are called multiway trees. (Chapter 10)


### Tree Terminology
-

### Path
- Think of a person going from node to node along the edges. This resulting sequence is called a path.
